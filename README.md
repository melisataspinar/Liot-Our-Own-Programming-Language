The aim of this project was to design and implement a programming language for IoT devices from scratch.

We first completed the BNF description of our language Liot. During the design process, we were mindful of how each decision would affect the readability, writability, and reliability of our language.

We then wrote our lexical analyzer, which you can find in the "lex" folder, together with a makefile. The txt file there holds a sample program written in Liot.

Finally, we made a parser for our language, which you can find in the "yacc" folder, together with a makefile. Again, the txt file there holds a sample program written in Liot.
